    <h3>Project topic Brainstorming</h3>
    <h4>Ideas</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Campus Food run: UWI students are given the luxury of having food delivered right
            outside their classrooms. This is to help the back to back class goers or even the laziest
            students. This service will be done by the students, for the students as students are the ones
            who will both make orders and do the deliveries. The deliveries will cost $5 + the food amount.
        </li>
        <li>
            International coin exchange: Frequent travellers all have the experience of discarding or
            hoarding their coins from foreign countries. This product, International coin exchange, will be
            placed in airports all over the globe. Travellers will simply dump their coins or bills into the
            allocated machine slots and a paper print out with the coin amount and a barcode/ scannable
            for identification/security. These printouts can be placed into machines in other airports and the
            local currency will be given in return (conversion will be done).
        </li>
        <li>
            UWI Student App- A media/ output for student queries, information and guidance.
        </li>
